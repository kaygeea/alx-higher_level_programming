0x09. Python - Everything is object

ALX SE project to test understanding of objects in Python. Below are reasons for responses to some of the queries:

Task 0 - type() can be used to check the data type of an object.

Task 1 - id() can be used to retrieve the memory address where a passed variable arg is stored.

Task 2 - No. Except they are objects, which they can't be because objects names that starts with numbers are not valid in Python.

Task 3 - Still no, because of the same reason in Task 2

Task 4 - 

Task 5 -

Task 20 - Yes, because an empty tuple can be formed by an empty pair of parentheses.

Task 21 - Yes, because a tuple is a collection of objects enclosed in a parentheses and separated by commas.

Task 22 - No, because a comma must follow an expression when creating a tuple 'singleton'.

Task 23 - Yes, becuase of the same reason that applies to task 22.

Task 24 - "True". Because the 'is' operator compares the identity of two objects and returns a Boolean depending on whether they're similar or not.

Task 25 - "True". Because of the same reason that applies to Task 24.

Task 26 - 

Task 27 - 

Task 28 -
