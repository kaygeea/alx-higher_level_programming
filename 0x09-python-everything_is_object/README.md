0x09. Python - Everything is object

ALX SE project to test understanding of objects in Python. Below are reasons for responses to some of the queries:

Task 0 - type() can be used to check the data type of an object.

Task 1 - id() can be used to retrieve the memory address where a passed variable arg is stored.

Task 2 - No. Although they are of the same object type(int), the 2 objects are not the same.

Task 3 - Still no, because of the same reason in Task 2

Task 4 - 

Task 5 - 

Task 6 - 

Task 7 - 

Task 8 - 

Task 9 - 

Task 10 - 

Task 11 - 

Task 12 - 

Task 13 - 

Task 14 - 

Task 15 - 

Task 16 - The "+=" operand revalues an assigned element by adding the value of an input to it.

Task 17 - .append() adds an item to the end of a list.

Task 18 - 

Task 19 - 

Task 20 - Yes, because an empty tuple can be formed by an empty pair of parentheses.

Task 21 - Yes, because a tuple is a collection of objects enclosed in a parentheses and separated by commas.

Task 22 - No, because a comma must follow an expression when creating a tuple 'singleton'.

Task 23 - Yes, becuase of the same reason that applies to task 22.

Task 24 - "True". Because the 'is' operator compares the identity of two objects and returns a Boolean depending on whether they're similar or not.

Task 25 - "True". Because of the same reason that applies to Task 24.

Task 26 - 

Task 27 - Yes. Because lists are mutable, changes can be made directly to the object at its original address.

Task 28 -
